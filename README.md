# Coconut 2D

Coconut2D is a software for creating HTML5, iOS, Android and PC games that your really design and code once, and play everywhere!

This GitHub Repository contains the Open Source **Coconut2D SDK**, which is the core toolchain and frameworks of Coconut2D project. Please note that this repository does not contain Coconut2D Studio IDE which is a commercial product.

## What is Coconut2D ?

Coconut2D Studio is a game creator software for developing casual and social games. The software is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Windows that unifies a vast array of cutting-edge 2D Game Design, Compilation and Debugging technologies, under a simple and easy to follow development process.

Coconut2D key design feature is a Flash-like Animation Scene Designer that helps you layout your game only once, and it automatically adapts it to every screen size, aspect ratio and pixel size. You can even preview your game live on various screen resolutions and dpi; this way you don't have to worry if your game will "fit" on every device. The designer can animate both Timeline-based animations as well as Sprite Animation Sequences. In fact, importing, editing, optimizing and testing Sprites has never been simpler! You can even export Box2D fixtures and bodies from any image contour and create games with complex 2D Physics.

Another key feature of Coconut2D is that it can compile both HTML5 and Native games from the same source code. Coconut2D primary programming language is Object Oriented JavaScript which is trans-compiled to ECMA JavaScript for running your games on HTML5 Browsers, and to C++11 code for post-compiling your games to native iOS, Android and PC apps. (We explain a lot about the technology below).

With this Kickstarter we want to complete Coconut2D, and extend it into producing games for HTML5 Browsers that run at Faster-than-JavaScript-Speeds, without binary plugins! This is possible thanks to the Emscripten compliler that produces about x10 times faster that "hand-written" JavaScript, from C++11 code. The same technology is expected to be used by Unity5!

Now if you connect the dots: 

Coconut2D is a game designer software unlike any other tool you tried before, especially in terms of compiler technology! It has many innovative design-time features for 2D games and it compiles native games for iOS, Android and PC, as well as HTML5 Browsers! All that by designing your game once, and coding in one programming language!
